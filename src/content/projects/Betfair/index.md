We ported the iOS webview apps onto Android. We had to ensure that the apps can be run on a variety of
devices and manufacturers and that it would not break in Android 16+ with minimal number
of 3rd party dependencies. I implemented a flexible architecture that respects the SOLID principles for
Push notifications, dynamic URL loading, deep linking and app flavours.
You need a VPN to Germany to access the apps on the Playstore
