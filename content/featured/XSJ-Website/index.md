A full-stack website built by my startup that I am leading. The front-end is written in Next.JS, React, and Typescript. The back-end consists of several microservices written in either Node/Express, Deno/Oak, or Nest.JS. The database being used is MongoDB. Unit and integration tests are being done with Mocha and Chai. AWS is being used for pipelines, servers and domain names (CodePipeline, EC2, ELB, Route 53, S3, Codebuild, VPC, etc.)
