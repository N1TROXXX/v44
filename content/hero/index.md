Hey, I’m Shiyan! I'm currently pursuing my 3rd year of [Computer Engineering in the Innovation stream](https://www.ece.queensu.ca/undergraduate/ECEi.html) and [Certificate in Business](https://smith.queensu.ca/academic_programs/certificate-in-business/index.php) at [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca/). I’m fascinated by artificial intelligence, data science, design, environmental sustainability, and entrepreneurship. I enjoy creating websites, applications, and everything in between.
