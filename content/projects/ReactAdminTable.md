A web 3.0 application built on the Avalanche blockchain for an NFT hackathon for Deloitte. Built it with one other dev over the span of 19 days. Picked as top 5 out of 33 teams. Still waiting on finalists to be announced.
React was used for the front end. Contracts were written in solidity. Users could mint NFTs with different user roles such as admin, minter, user and moderator. Users could see their NFTs in the UI. NFTs would then be used to login to a system with defined privileges.
